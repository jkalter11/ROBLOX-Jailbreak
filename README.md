# Intro
Hello there valued human! Thank you for downloading this program! Roblox Jailbreak is a version of Garry's Mod jailbreak, but for ROBLOX! Yay! If you were expecting a map with this download, well I hate to burst your bubble, but this is only software. Either build a map or commision someone to do so for you. This only has software to help with your jailing experiences! Despite this, I hope you find this useful.

#Installation
Installation is quite simple - just do the following:

1.) Open up ROBLOX Studio and open up the place where you have your map

2.) Go to the view tab and make sure that explorer is open

3.) Copy and paste all the files to the explorer, however make sure everything in the folders match up with everything in the download - i.e put everything in the StarterGui folder in the StarterGui folder in the Explorer (I'll make an image tutorial explaining this later)

4.) If you wish to change how long each round lasts, then go to ReplicatedStorage -> timeLeft, go to it's properties menu and change it's value. By default it is 600, which means 600 seconds, 10 minutes.

4.) Profit!

See? Simple!

#Playing 
Some terms for you to remember:

KOS - Kill on sight. For example, if a prisoner is spotted in a KOS area (i.e the armory), he will be immediately killed if found there.

RDM - Random Death Match - This is when a guard kills a prisoner without any reason to. Guards doing this can / should be kicked with the vote kick module (TO BE ADDED)

LR - Last request (see below - tl;dr what the last remaining prisoner wants))

DR - Death request (see below - tl;dr how the last remaining prisoner wants to die)

While of course nothing is stopping you from playing this any way you like, here are the semi-official rules for Jailbreak:

All the prisoners start in locked cells. As the time ticks down, the guards have until 9 minutes 30 seconds (time starts at 10 minutes) to unlock all cells. One of the guards is the warden, and he runs everything. Every day, there are certain games that the warden can choose to play, depending on his creativity and what the map offers. Additionaly, the warden can choose to make the day a freeday, where prisoners can do whatever they want, as long as they do not enter KOS areas (see above) or attack guards. Some rules:

If a guard kills a prisoner, that guard HAS to have a reason for doing so, otherwise that guard can be kicked or slayed. (Neither of these functions are ready yet, so just use an admin tools package or something) That said, if there is only one guard left and less than 3 prisoners, all prisoners are KOS.

The prisoners win if they kill all the guards - however while they are certainly not stopped from doing so, prisoners aren't really supposed to go on a rampage unless they have the weapons for doing so. But hey, nothing is stopping you!

If the warden dies, it is instantly a freeday.

If there is only one prisoner left, the guards must ask that prisoner what is his Last Request (LR) and Death Request (DR) is. Keep in mind that if a prisoner is not cooperating, the guards do not have to give him LR/DR. A last request is something the prisoner wants for the next round. A prisoner can request freeday, freeday for themselves / anyone else they want to take, or a game they want to do next round. They CAN NOT request to be placed on the guard team, to be next round's warden, or otherwise anything the warden considers stupid/dumb/outragous/you get the deal.

Unfortunately, ROBLOX does not allow VOIP, so all communication will have to be done through chat. Kinda sucks :/

Keyboard commands!

F2 - Switch teams
F4 - For guards, this pulls up a menu to claim warden if no one is already warden. For prisoners, this pulls up an LR menu if they are the last remaining prisoner (LR MENU NOT READY AT THIS TIME)
